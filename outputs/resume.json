    "professional_summary": "I am currently a machine learning scientist at Amazon Alexa, working on building AI assistant that is able to replicate human intelligence. I am passionate about applied AI research that drives tangible impact for products and services. With over 5 years of post-PhD experience in the field of ML/AI, I possess strong skills in model development and performance evaluation, and am proficient in Python and deep learning frameworks. While successfully incubating and delivering multiple projects at Amazon, I am involved in all phases of the development cycle \u2013 from building proof of concept to delivering minimum viable products and scaling up production. I have experience in supervising master\u2019s theses and research internships, as well as coaching and mentoring junior team members.",
